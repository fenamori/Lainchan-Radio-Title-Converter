# Lainchan-Radio-Title-Converter
Lainchan Radio has an issue where titles that use kana are displayed as its base-10 value instead of the actual character (ex. `&#12512;` instead of ãƒ ). This simple script fixes the titles to make them readable/searchable.

(this is mostly just something I did for a little bit of practice, sorry if there's bugs!)
